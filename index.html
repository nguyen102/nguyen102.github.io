                                    <p>In August of 2017, I participated in Startup Weekend DC. This is a three day event where you come up with an idea for a startup, prototype it, do market validation, and present your idea to a panel of judges. Our idea was a web app to help people find what they're looking for a local farmer's market and to preorder those items so its ready when they arrive. The judges love our idea, prototype, and presentation. As a result we won <a href='https://twitter.com/sw_dc/status/894347715513122816' target="_blank"/>second place!</a> </p>

                                    <p>My uncle opened up a pho restaurant in Mechanicsburg, PA. He asked me to build a website for the restaurant that would show people the restaurant from their computer. The website should provide people with important information such as menu, hours, and location of the restaurant. Based on his needs I decided to build a clean one page website with all of the information that he had requested. </p>

                                    <p>I'm the type of person who loves adventure and exploration, but with a busy schedule, it's hard to make the time to figure out what cool events are going on in town. In the past I use to rely on searching FB events and general Googling. That was until I decided to build "Events in DC".  "Events in DC" is an events aggregator that searches local DC websites for new and interesting events going on in town. It does this once a day and presents its findings in a single webpage. In conjunction with that, it also gives users the option of having a daily email sent to their inbox. </p>

                                    <p>Having good company to eat lunch or dinner with can make an average meal into a great meal. However, it is often tiresome and inconvinient to find friends who are available to grab food with. This is where Grumbly comes in. Grumbly is an app that allows the user to easily find nearby friends to grab food with. The app shows the user's friends on a map overlay and suggests restaurants that the user and their friends can eat at. This was a project that I worked on at Startup Weekend DC during the weekend of September 25, 2015. We won the audience choice award.</p>

                                    <p>Finding parking in the city is never easy, and what's more even more annoying than not being able to find parking, is not being able to find where you park your car after leaving it. Therefore, I decided to create a parking app that would store the information that I use most often when trying to find my car: the GPS coordinate of my car, a note about the location of my car, and a picture showing the area in which I park. This parking app (Where Is My Car?) allows me to input as much or as little parking information as I would like.</p>

                                    <p>For this project, I worked on a team of five to try and change the current online dating scene. As a group we felt that the current online dating scene was too superficial and focused on looks, instead of really getting to know the person. We worked on designing an app that would focus on helping users get to know each other better before they meet. Options that were explored include: in-app icebreakers to help matches learn more about each other, simple games to help matches bond, and coaching tips to help guide users through the dating process.</p>

                                    <p>The Fleye Ball was a gadget that my two friends and I built for our final project during Junior year of college. For the final project our task was to design and come up with a project that can be built, tested, and presented to the class. Our team decided to build the Fleye Ball which was designed to take aerial photos of the terrain. When a user wants to see his surroundings from a bird's eye view, he would throw the Fleye Ball into the air by using the ball's tail to gain speed and momentum. Once the Fleye Ball reaches the apex of its flight, it turns downward and takes a picture of the terrain. It detects the apex by using an inbuilt accelerometer. Once the picture is captured and the ball is back in the user's hand, it wirelessly transmit the picture of the landscape to the user's computer. To see a YouTube video of the Fleye Ball in action click "Find out more". </p>

                                <p>During my internship with Amazon Studios, I developed an administrative web tool to improve the workflow of internal Amazon customers. The tool was built using Ruby on Rails. I built all parts of the tools including the Model, the View, and the controller. At the end of my internship, the team had a production ready administrative tool that was in use by our customers. </p>
